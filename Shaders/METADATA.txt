- shader_model must be between 6_0 and 6_8. Some shader models are not available depending on the entry point's shader stage.
- entry_points can contain the following values (min 1):
  -> PSMain  for Pixel shader stage
  -> VSMain  for Vertex shader stage
  -> GSMain  for Geometry shader stage
  -> HSMain  for Hull shader stage
  -> DSMain  for Domain shader stage
  -> CSMain  for Compute shader stage
  -> LIBMain for Raytracing shaders
  -> MSMain  for Mesh shader stage
  -> ASMain  for Acceleration shader stage
- keywords is optional. Determines all keywords permutations that needs to be compiled. The no-keyword version of the shader is always compiled.
